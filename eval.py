The key learning is that a **hybrid approach, combining semantic (vector) and keyword (BM25) search, consistently outperforms a naive baseline**. While the learned reranker shows promise, its performance is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of training data, and with only 8 labeled questions, it provides a subtle but sometimes less consistent improvement compared to the hand-tuned hybrid model. The simplicity and robustness of the hybrid reranker make it a highly effective and practical choice for many real-world applications.\n\n")
